Java is an object oriented general purpose programming language and computing platform for developing application. 
Java can be download freely and can also be accessed freely.
Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine.
Java compiler produces a unique type of code called bytecode. 
The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. 
Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent. 
This bytecode is sent to Java virtual machine (JVM) which resides in the RAM of any operating system. 
The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different platforms.
JVM recognizes the platform it is on and converts the bytecodes into native machine code. Hence java is called platform independent language.
The run-time requirements for Java are very small.
The Java virtual machine takes care of all hardware-related issues, so that no code has to be compiled for different hardware.
