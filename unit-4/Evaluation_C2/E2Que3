Question 3:
Explain about String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder class with an example. Explain also
about toString() method in java.

String:
It is immutable class. In Java, string is basically an object that represents combination of any char or no etc, we write string in"". 
Example:
String s="Krti1234"; 

StringBuffer : It is mutable , and takes more time to implement.Allocates a new string from the string in StringBuffer
StringBuffer is synchronized it is thread safe so two thread can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
example:
StringBuffer sbuffer = new StringBuffer("Krutika");
String k = new String(sbuffer); //Krutika


StringBuilder:–  It is mutable , and takes more time to implement.Allocates a new string from the string in StringBuilder
StringBuilder is non-synchronized, it is not thread safe so two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
example:
StringBuilder sbuilder = new StringBuilder("Krutika");
String s = new String(sbuilder); //Krutika


toString() method
This method returns the String representation of the object with any parameters passed into it;
If you print any object, Java compiler internally invokes the toString() method on the object. 
So overriding the toString() method, returns the desired output  implementation.

Example  
public String toString(){ 
  return name+" "+age+" "+gender;  
 }
