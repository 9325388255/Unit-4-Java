Question) What is the difference between the Checked and Unchecked exceptions explain it with an example? 
How to create a User-defined unchecked exception class.


Checked and unchecked exceptions both are types of logical errors which may happen at runtime. 
For all logical errors, JVM creates an Exception object during the execution.

Unchecked exceptions
--------------------
1.The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions
2.Unchecked exceptions are those exceptions even if not handled using try-catch, the Java compiler does not give any compilation error. 
3.It allows the file to compile and if error happens JVM creates the object and terminates program abnormally. 
4.Unchecked exceptions are direct child classes for RuntimeException class.
For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.

For example/

int x = 10/0;

This will raise an ArithmeticException object but java compiler won't force you to handle it before the compilation and allows you to compile the program.

Checked exceptions
--------------------
1.The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.
2.Checked exceptions are those for which the Java compiler gives a compilation error.
3.and forces the developer to handle the exception before the compilation. 
4.Java compiler does not compile the file if these exceptions are not handled. 
5.Checked exceptions are direct child classes of Exception class.
For example, IOException, SQLException, etc
For example/

try{
	Class.forName("Student");
}
catch(ClassNotFoundException cnfe){
	System.out.println(cnfe.getMessage());
}

Here we are loading a class in the context area of our RAM, and there might be a possibility that class may not exists and it may not get loaded.
 This is a checked exception, and if the logic is not wrapped inside a try-catch block the Java compiler gives a compiler error.

===============================================================================================================================================

To create a user-defined unchecked exception we need to extend RuntimeException class and establish IS-A relationship with RuntimeException class.

For example/

public class AgeNotVerifiedException extends RuntimeException
{
	public AgeNotVerifiedException()
	{
		//
	}

	public AgeNotVerifiedException(String message)
	{
		super(message);
	}
}
