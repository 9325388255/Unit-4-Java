Race-condition:

1.Java is a multi-threaded programming language and there is a higher risk to occur race conditions. Because the
same resource may be accessed by multiple threads at the same time and may change the data.

2.A race-condition is a condition in which the critical section (a part of the program where shared memory is accessed)
is concurrently executed by two or more threads. It leads to incorrect behavior of a program.

3.In layman terms, a race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to
get certain shared resources.
For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error.

4.To solve the data inconsistency problem in java synchronized keyword is used.
So the thread-safety is achieved and race condition is avoided by the help of synchronized keyword
