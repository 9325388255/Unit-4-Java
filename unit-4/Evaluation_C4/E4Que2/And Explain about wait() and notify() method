Explain about wait() and notify() method
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wait()

1.Whenever we need to suspend a synchronized thread unconditionally that time we use wait() method.
2.In the inter thread communication the thread which require updation it has to call wait() method.
3.Once a thread calls wait() method on any object, first it releases the lock immediately of that
particular object and then it enters into the waiting state immediately.
4.Wait method belongs from Object class because "a thread" can call these methods on any java object.
5.We can call wait() only in the synchronized block or synchronized methods otherwise we will get a runtime exception
6.To call wait() method on any object we must have that particular object lock otherwise we will 
get a runtime exception called IllegalMonitorStateException.

notify()

1.Whenever we need to resume a suspended or waiting thread then we use notify() method.
2.The thread which performing updation it will call notify() method, so that waiting thread will 
gets the notification and it continues its execution with those updation.
3.Once a thread calls notify() method on any object it also releases the lock of that object but not immediately.
4.Notify method belongs from Object class because "a thread" can call these methods on any java object.
5.We can call notify()only in the synchronized block or synchronized methods otherwise we will get a runtime exception
6.To call notify() method on any object we must have that particular object lock otherwise we will
get a runtime exception called IllegalMonitorStateException.
